## Recent Changes (2025-08-08)

### Major NLP System Upgrade ‚ú®
- **Revolutionary upgrade:** Implemented advanced Neural Language Processing system
- **New capabilities added:**
  - üìñ **Story Generator** - creates engaging stories based on topics (–∫–æ—Ç, —Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∞, –º–∞—Ä—Å, –ø—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ)
  - üî¨ **Explanation Engine** - provides detailed explanations (–º–∞—à–∏–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ, —Ñ–æ—Ç–æ—Å–∏–Ω—Ç–µ–∑, –ò–ò)
  - üí° **Personal Advisor** - gives customized advice for memory, learning, productivity
  - ü§ñ **Intent Analysis** - identifies user goals (stories, explanations, advice, creative requests)
  - üé≠ **Emotional Intelligence** - detects and responds to emotional tone
